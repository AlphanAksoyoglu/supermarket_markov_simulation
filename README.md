__The project involves the following tasks:__

1. [explore the data](https://krspiced.pythonanywhere.com/chapters/project_markov/data_analysis.html#explore-supermarket-data) (includes `pandas` wrangling)
2. [calculate transition probabilities](https://krspiced.pythonanywhere.com/chapters/project_markov/markov_chain/README.html#transition-probs) (a 5x5 matrix)
3. [create a customer class and implement MCMC for one customer](https://krspiced.pythonanywhere.com/chapters/project_markov/classes/README.html#mcmc-simu)
4. [create a supermarket class that simulates multiple customers](https://krspiced.pythonanywhere.com/chapters/project_markov/program_design/README.html#sim-population)
5. [visualize the supermarket](https://krspiced.pythonanywhere.com/chapters/project_markov/classes/inheritance.html#draw-from-tiles)

Extra:

- [fill the shelves of a supermarket image](https://krspiced.pythonanywhere.com/chapters/project_markov/numpy/README.html#fill-shelves)
- [clean up your code](https://krspiced.pythonanywhere.com/chapters/project_markov/python_code_style/pep8_code_style.html#pylint-ex)
